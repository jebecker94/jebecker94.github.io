I am an economist at Bates White Economic Consulting. Previously, I worked at the Office of Financial Research, U.S. Department of the Treasury (2024-2025). My research focuses on Industrial Organization with emphasis on the U.S. residential mortgage market, particularly information asymmetries between buyers and sellers in whole loan trades. I employ econometric and machine learning techniques to analyze mortgage performance patterns, originator beliefs, and investor pricing strategies.
